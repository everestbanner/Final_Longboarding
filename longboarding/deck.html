			The first step to making a
			longboard in making the deck. 
			The deck is the big piece of 
			wood that you plant your feet
			on while riding. 
			<br>First off
			you have to decide what you
			want your deck to look like. 
			This part is really up to you,
			there are a few standard 
			designs you can go with or you 
			can get creative, the 
			only thing to watch for is 
			that you make sure there is 
			enough room for a good longboarding
			stance, which is your feet planted
			about shoulder width apart. And you
			need to make sure the board is
			narrow at the ends where you'll 
			put the wheels, so that as you're
			turning the board doesn't hit 
			you wheels and throw you off your 
			board, but make sure you ends 
			where the wheels aren't too small for
			your trucks.
			</id></p>
			
			<p id="p2">
			Some standard dimensions for your board	
			would be around 8-10 inches 
			wide by 32-36 inches long by 1/2-1 inch thick.
			</id></p>
			
			<p id="p3">
			The material you want 
			to use for the deck
			should always be a plywood,
			due to flexibility purposes. 
			The most used woods to use 
			are baltic birch and maple.
			They provide the durability
			necessary for the ride.
			</id></p>
			
			<p id="p4">
			A tip for cutting out your
			board; get a big enough piece
			of paper to sketch your whole
			board, fold it in half, down
			the middle and sketch half 
			your board along the folded
			edge, then you can cut out a
			perfectly symmetrical design 
			when you cut away the excess
			paper. Unfold the paper and 
			trace the design on the wood
			you are using for the deck.
