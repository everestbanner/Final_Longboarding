			After you have decided your trucks, 
            you should decide on the wheels. 
            Like the trucks, 
            these have a lot of personal 
            preferences to them, all depending 
            on what kind of boarding you 
            like to do.
			<br>
			The first step to finding the 
            right wheels are the hight. You'll 
            want to make sure that the wheels 
            will fit on your board and 
            have enough room for turning. 
            The taller the wheel, the smoother 
            the ride and the higher the top 
            speed, how ever it will be harder 
            to get going. For more of a free ride 
            small board wheel go between 
            60mm-70mm wheels, but for a bigger 
            board go for something 70mm-80mm.

			<p id="p2">
			Next thing to consider for 
            your wheels would be the 
            edge of the wheel, or the 
            lip. If the wheel has a 
            sharp edge it will have 
            significantly more grip 
            on turns then if you buy 
            a wheel with a rounded 
            edge. If you want to be 
            able to slide, get a 
            rounded edge.
			</id></p>
			<p id="p3">
			The width of the wheel is 
			also a huge factor in how 
			much grip you have on the 
			road, the more surface 
			contact to the road, the 
			more grip you have, thinner 
			wheels will be better for 
			sliding.
			</id></p>
			<p id="p4">
			Next to take into
            consideration is the softness 
            of the wheel which is 
            called the durometer of 
            the wheel. The higher the 
            number the harder the wheel. 
            Softer wheels are used for 
            longboarding from 70a to about 85a.
            A softer wheel (from 70a-78a) will 
            grip the road a lot better and 
            produce a smoother ride, 
            but will make it harder 
            to slide, then a harder wheel 
            (80a-86a) is more for tricks 
            and will go faster, also
            a harder wheel will last 
            longer, but you'll 
            be able to feel the bumps of 
            the road better.

			Lastly, you have the set of the 
            wheel, where the middle that 
            holds the barring is on the wheel. 
            Some wheels have the bearing holder
            in the middle and others on the edges. 
            Center set wheels are nice 
            because the have the most 
            grip and will increase you 
            a life time of the wheels, 
            because you can flip them 
            after they ware down. But
            side set wheels have a bit 
            more handle for braking and 
            catching grip when sliding. 
            Beginners should always go with 
            side set wheels first. <a href="http://www.tactics.com/info/choosing-longboard-wheels"> click here for a more indepth exsplination. </a>
